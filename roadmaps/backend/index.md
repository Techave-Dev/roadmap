## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which programming language should I learn first?**
A: For beginners, we recommend **TypeScript/Node.js** (if going full-stack) or **Python** (if interested in data/ML). Both have great communities and job opportunities.

**Q: Do I need to know frontend to be a backend developer?**
A: No, but basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript helps. Focus on backend concepts, but knowing how frontends consume APIs is valuable.

**Q: How long does it take to become job-ready?**
A: 
- **Self-paced**: 6-12 months of consistent learning and building projects
- **Internship program**: 1-3 months for intensive, focused learning
- **Real job-ready**: Add 6-12 months of practical experience

**Q: Should I learn SQL or NoSQL first?**
A: Start with **SQL (PostgreSQL)**. It's more widely used and teaches important data modeling concepts. You can learn NoSQL later when you need it.

**Q: Do I need a computer science degree?**
A: No. Many successful backend developers are self-taught or bootcamp graduates. Focus on building projects and demonstrating skills.

**Q: What's the internship program?**
A: A structured 1-3 month program focused on NestJS, TypeScript, and Prisma with mentorship and real project experience.

**Q: Can I do the internship program while working full-time?**
A: The internship is designed for full-time commitment (40 hours/week).
