## Quick Summary

A structured internship roadmap for backend development using **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, **Zod**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

**Every program has two phases:**
1. **Learning Phase** - Master the tech stack
2. **Final Project Phase** - Apply knowledge through one of three project types:
   - 🏢 Internal System (build internal tools)
   - 🌍 Real-World App (join production projects)
   - 🚀 New Application (create from scratch)

Choose your duration:

## Duration Options - Quick Comparison

| Duration | Learning Phase | Final Project Phase | Best For |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| **1 Month** | Weeks 1-2: Fundamentals | Weeks 3-4: Small project | Quick entry, basic skills |
| **2 Months** | Weeks 1-4: Advanced concepts | Weeks 5-8: Medium project | Solid foundation, ownership |
| **3 Months** | Weeks 1-5: Expert patterns | Weeks 6-12: Large project | Deep mastery, leadership |

### Project Options (Same for All Durations)

Every intern chooses ONE project type for the final phase:

- **🏢 Internal System**: Build tools for the company (e.g., admin dashboard, API portal)
- **🌍 Real-World App**: Join existing production codebases and ship features
- **🚀 New Application**: Create your own app from scratch and deploy it

The **scope and complexity** scale with your program duration:
- 1-month: Small, focused features
- 2-month: Medium-sized modules  
- 3-month: Large, complex systems
