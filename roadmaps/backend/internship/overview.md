# Backend Internship Program - Overview

A structured internship roadmap for backend development using **NestJS**, **TypeScript**, **Zod**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Program Structure

Every internship follows a **two-phase approach**:

### Phase 1: Learning Phase
Master the tech stack through structured curriculum:
- TypeScript fundamentals and advanced patterns
- NestJS architecture and best practices
- Prisma ORM and database design
- Testing, validation, and security
- Real-world development workflows

### Phase 2: Final Project Phase
Apply your knowledge through **one of three project options**:

| Project Option | Description | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **🏢 Internal System** | Propose and build a tool for internal use (e.g., admin dashboard, analytics tool, developer portal) | Interns who want to solve real business problems |
| **🌍 Real-World App** | Join an existing production application and contribute features | Interns who want immediate production experience |
| **🚀 New Application** | Create a complete application from scratch with your own idea | Interns who want full ownership and creative freedom |

**The project option you choose depends on:**
- Your interests and career goals
- Available opportunities at the time
- Mentor recommendations based on your progress
- Company needs and priorities

Choose your duration based on availability and how deep you want to go:
