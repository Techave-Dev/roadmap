## Detailed Evaluation Rubrics

### Code Quality

#### Excellent (90-100%)
```typescript
// Clean, well-organized
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(
    private prisma: PrismaService,
    private emailService: EmailService,
  ) {}

  /**
   * Creates a new user account
   * @throws ConflictException if email already exists
   * @throws BadRequestException if validation fails
   */
  async createUser(dto: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    await this.validateUniqueEmail(dto.email);
    
    const hashedPassword = await this.hashPassword(dto.password);
    
    const user = await this.prisma.user.create({
      data: {
        ...dto,
        password: hashedPassword,
      },
    });

    await this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user);
    
    return this.sanitizeUser(user);
  }

  private async validateUniqueEmail(email: string): Promise<void> {
    const exists = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email } });
    if (exists) throw new ConflictException('Email already registered');
  }

  private async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
    return bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
  }

  private sanitizeUser(user: User): User {
    const { password, ...sanitized } = user;
    return sanitized as User;
  }
}
```

**Why Excellent:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Clear method names
- Proper error handling
- No magic numbers
- Well-documented
- Testable design

#### Satisfactory (70-79%)
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private prisma: PrismaService) {}

  async createUser(dto: CreateUserDto) {
    const user = await this.prisma.user.findUnique({ 
      where: { email: dto.email } 
    });
    
    if (user) {
      throw new Error('Email exists');
    }
    
    const hashed = await bcrypt.hash(dto.password, 10);
    
    return this.prisma.user.create({
      data: { ...dto, password: hashed },
    });
  }
}
```

**Issues:**
- Missing return type
- Generic error instead of proper exception
- No documentation
- Password logic mixed with user creation
- No email sending

### Testing Quality

#### Excellent (90-100%)
```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  let service: UserService;
  let prisma: DeepMockProxy<PrismaService>;
  let emailService: DeepMockProxy<EmailService>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    prisma = mockDeep<PrismaService>();
    emailService = mockDeep<EmailService>();
    service = new UserService(prisma, emailService);
  });

  describe('createUser', () => {
    const validDto = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123', name: 'Test' };

    it('should create user with hashed password', async () => {
      prisma.user.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(null);
      prisma.user.create.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);

      const result = await service.createUser(validDto);

      expect(prisma.user.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        data: expect.objectContaining({
          email: validDto.email,
          password: expect.not.stringMatching(validDto.password),
        }),
      });
      expect(result).not.toHaveProperty('password');
    });

    it('should send welcome email', async () => {
      prisma.user.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(null);
      prisma.user.create.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);

      await service.createUser(validDto);

      expect(emailService.sendWelcomeEmail).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
        expect.objectContaining({ email: validDto.email })
      );
    });

    it('should throw ConflictException if email exists', async () => {
      prisma.user.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(existingUser);

      await expect(service.createUser(validDto))
        .rejects
        .toThrow(ConflictException);
    });

    it('should not send email if creation fails', async () => {
      prisma.user.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(null);
      prisma.user.create.mockRejectedValue(new Error('DB error'));

      await expect(service.createUser(validDto)).rejects.toThrow();
      
      expect(emailService.sendWelcomeEmail).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
```

**Why Excellent:**
- Comprehensive coverage
- Tests behavior, not implementation
- Edge cases covered
- Clear test names
- Proper mocking
- Tests isolation

### Communication & Presentation

#### Excellent Example
**Pull Request Description:**
```markdown
## Summary
Implements user registration with email verification flow.

## Changes
- Add POST /auth/register endpoint
- Implement email verification token generation
- Add email service integration for verification emails
- Create database migration for verification tokens

## Technical Decisions
- Used JWT for verification tokens (expires in 24h)
- Implemented token-based verification instead of email links for security
- Added rate limiting (5 attempts per hour) to prevent abuse

## Testing
- Unit tests for auth service (95% coverage)
- Integration tests for /auth/register endpoint
- E2E test for complete registration flow
- Manual testing with different email providers
