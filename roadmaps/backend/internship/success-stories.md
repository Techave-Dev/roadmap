### From Kevin (New Application):
> "Building from scratch is exhilarating and terrifying. You have total freedom but also total responsibility. My advice: steal liberally from open source projects you admire. Study their code structure, error handling, testing patterns. Don't reinvent the wheel."

### From Lisa (New Application):
> "Start simple and add features incrementally. I initially planned 20 features but shipped with 8 core ones. Those 8 were rock-solid. Better to have fewer features that work perfectly than many features that are buggy."
