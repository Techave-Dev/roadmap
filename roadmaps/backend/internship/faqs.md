---

## General Questions

### Q: Can I switch between program durations?

**A:** Yes, with mentor approval. If you're excelling in the 1-month program, you can extend to 2 or 3 months. Conversely, if you're struggling in a longer program, we can adjust scope.

---

### Q: What if I have prior backend experience?

**A:** You can accelerate through fundamentals. Take Week 1 assessment to demonstrate competency. Your mentor will create a customized learning plan focusing on advanced topics.

---

### Q: Is this remote, hybrid, or on-site?

**A:** All options available. Discuss with HR and mentor. Remote interns must:
- Be available during core hours (10 AM - 3 PM company timezone)
- Attend daily standups via video
- Have reliable internet

---

### Q: Will I receive a certificate?

**A:** Yes! Upon successful completion (passing score: 70%+ for 1-month, 80%+ for 2-month, 85%+ for 3-month), you'll receive:
- Official completion certificate
- Detailed evaluation report
- LinkedIn recommendation from mentor (optional)

---

### Q: Can international students apply?

**A:** Yes, but must have valid work authorization in the company's country. We cannot sponsor visas for internships.

---

### Q: Is this paid?

**A:** Contact HR for compensation details. Most backend internships in tech pay $25-$40/hour (varies by location and experience).

---

## Technical Questions

### Q: Do I need to know TypeScript before starting?

**A:** No. Basic JavaScript knowledge is sufficient. Week 1 teaches TypeScript fundamentals. However, familiarity with JavaScript will help you learn faster.

---

### Q: What if I get stuck on a problem?

**A:** Follow the "30-minute rule":
1. Try solving it yourself (15 mins)
2. Google, read docs, search Stack Overflow (15 mins)
3. If still stuck, ask your mentor or team

Document what you tried—helps mentor understand your thought process.

---

### Q: Can I use different technologies than the core stack?

**A:** The core stack (NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Zod) is fixed—these are what you'll learn. For specific use cases, you can propose additional tools with mentor approval.

**Example:** If building a feature requiring image processing, you could propose adding Sharp library.

---

### Q: How much time should I dedicate daily?

**A:** This is a full-time commitment: 40 hours/week, 8 hours/day, 5 days/week. Quality of work matters more than hours, but consistent daily work is expected.

**Typical Day:**
- 09:00-12:00: Deep work (coding/learning)
- 12:00-13:00: Lunch
- 13:00-16:00: Deep work
- 16:00-17:00: Code review / documentation / meetings

---

### Q: What if I can't meet a deadline?

**A:** Communicate early! If you realize you'll miss a deadline:
1. Tell your mentor ASAP (not the day before)
2. Explain what's blocking you
3. Propose a solution (need help? need more time?)

Missing a deadline isn't a failure—failing to communicate is.

---

### Q: How hard is the program compared to university?

**A:** Different kind of hard:
- **University:** Focused on theory, exams, individual work
- **This:** Practical, real codebase, team collaboration, production quality

Interns report: "Harder in some ways (production quality bar is high), easier in others (practical learning, immediate feedback)."

---

## Project Selection Questions

### Q: When do I choose my final project type?

**A:** At the end of the Learning Phase:
- **1-month program:** End of Week 2
- **2-month program:** End of Week 4
- **3-month program:** End of Week 5

Your mentor will schedule a project assignment meeting where you'll discuss options together.

---

### Q: Can I request a specific project type?

**A:** Yes! You can express preferences. Final assignment depends on:
- **Your skill progress** during Learning Phase
- **Company needs** and available opportunities
- **Mentor assessment** of best fit
- **Your interests** and career goals

We try to accommodate preferences whenever possible, but sometimes business needs take priority.

---

### Q: What's the difference between the three project types?

**A:**

| Project Type | What You Build | Mentorship Style | Best For |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| 🏢 **Internal System** | Tools for company teams | High collaboration | Learning requirements gathering |
| 🌍 **Real-World App** | Features for existing apps | Code review heavy | Learning established patterns |
| 🚀 **New Application** | Your own project from scratch | High autonomy | Building portfolio |

All three are valuable—there's no "better" option.

---

### Q: What if I want to switch project types mid-way?

**A:** Generally **not recommended**. Switching requires:
- Starting over on requirements and design
- Extended timeline (usually 1-2 weeks)
- Strong justification

**Rare exceptions:**
- Original project becomes impossible (e.g., stakeholder leaves company)
- You're severely struggling and mentor recommends change

If you're unsure, discuss concerns with mentor **early** (within first week of Final Project Phase).

---

### Q: Do Internal System projects become part of production?

**A:** Yes! Internal systems are **real tools** used by the team, not practice projects. Examples:
- Developer onboarding portal → Used for every new hire
- Analytics dashboard → Used daily by ops team
- API documentation generator → Integrated into CI/CD

Your work has immediate impact on team productivity.

---

### Q: For Real-World App option, what if I can't ship code?

**A:** This is **rare** with proper mentorship (happens less than 5% of time). We ensure:
- Tasks are appropriately scoped for your skill level
- Extensive code review before merging
- Mentor pair-programs if you're stuck

If code quality isn't production-ready, you'll iterate with mentor guidance until it is. The goal is to **learn**, not to fail.

---

### Q: For Real-World App, do I get to pick which app?

**A:** Usually no—we assign based on:
- Current team needs
- Codebase complexity matching your level
- Available mentor capacity

You'll be informed which app during project assignment meeting.

---

### Q: For New Application option, do I have to deploy it?

**A:** **Yes, deployment is required.** You'll learn to deploy to platforms like:
- Railway
- Render
- Heroku
- AWS/GCP (with mentor guidance)
- Company's internal infrastructure

Deployment is a critical skill. We provide resources and support.

---

### Q: Can I build my startup idea as a New Application?

**A:** **Absolutely!** As long as it:
- Demonstrates all required technical skills (NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Zod)
- Fits within program scope (achievable in time allotted)
- Has clear success criteria
- Is approved by mentor

Many successful New Application projects were startup ideas or portfolio pieces.

---

### Q: What if my Internal System project idea gets rejected?

**A:** Proposals often need iteration. Common rejection reasons:
- **Too broad:** Scope down to MVP
- **Business value unclear:** Better articulate who benefits and how
- **Duplicates existing tool:** Propose enhancement instead, or find different gap

You'll iterate with mentor (usually 2-3 rounds) until approved. Rejection is part of the process, not a failure.

---

### Q: How much guidance do I get for each project type?

**A:**

**🏢 Internal System:**
- High guidance on requirements (you talk to stakeholders with mentor)
- Medium guidance on implementation (you decide architecture)
- Regular check-ins with users

**🌍 Real-World App:**
- High guidance on code patterns (follow existing conventions)
- Frequent code reviews
- Close mentor supervision

**🚀 New Application:**
- Medium guidance on architecture (you propose, mentor reviews)
- You make most decisions
- Weekly check-ins (not daily)

All projects get mentor support—just different styles.

---

### Q: Can I work on a team project with another intern?

**A:** **Rarely.** Final projects are typically **individual** to assess your abilities. Exceptions:
- 3-month program with very large scope
- Two interns with complementary skills (frontend + backend)
- Mentor explicitly recommends collaboration

Even then, your contributions must be clearly identifiable.

---

### Q: What if I finish my project early?

**A:** Great problem to have! Options:
1. **Add stretch goals** (discussed during project planning)
2. **Polish and improve** (better tests, documentation, performance)
3. **Start another small project** with mentor approval
4. **Help other interns** (code reviews, knowledge sharing)

Quality > speed. We'd rather see one excellent project than two rushed ones.

---

### Q: What if I'm behind schedule on my project?

**A:** Communicate **immediately**. Solutions depend on reason:
- **Technical blocker:** Mentor helps unblock (pair programming, resources)
- **Scope too large:** Cut features, focus on MVP
- **Personal issues:** Discuss timeline extension with mentor + HR

**Key:** Tell us early (Week 1-2 of Final Project), not late (final week).

---

## Program-Specific Questions

### 1-Month Program

**Q: Can I really contribute to production in 4 weeks?**  
**A:** Yes! Week 1-2 you learn, Week 3-4 you contribute. Previous interns have merged 3-5 PRs to production. You'll work on well-defined, beginner-friendly tasks.

**Q: Will I work alone or with a team?**  
**A:** With a team. You'll join an existing project, attend standups, do code reviews, and collaborate daily.

---

### 2-Month Program

**Q: What if I can't think of a good project idea?**  
**A:** Don't worry! Your mentor will help during project assignment meeting (end of Week 4). We also have a list of pre-approved project ideas. The goal is finding something that interests you AND adds business value.

**Q: What if my project proposal gets rejected?**  
**A:** We iterate on proposals. Rarely does a first draft get approved without changes. Expect 2-3 rounds of feedback before approval. This is part of the learning process—learning to scope and present ideas is a valuable skill.

**Q: Which project type is most common for 2-month programs?**  
**A:** 
- 🏢 Internal System: 40%
- 🌍 Real-World App: 35%
- 🚀 New Application: 25%

Internal Systems are popular because 8 weeks is perfect for a well-scoped internal tool.

---

### 3-Month Program

**Q: Is 3 months enough to build a complete application?**  
**A:** Yes, with proper scoping. You'll build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), not a feature-complete application. Focus on core functionality that delivers value. Extra features can be future work.

**Example MVP scope:**
- User auth + 3 core features + basic admin panel = Achievable
- User auth + 10 features + advanced analytics + mobile app = Too much

**Q: What happens to my project after the internship?**  
**A:** 
- **Internal System:** Goes into production, maintained by team (or you, if hired)
- **Real-World App:** Your features are already in production
- **New Application:** Deployed and documented. May become company product, or remains in your portfolio

If hired, you might continue maintaining/enhancing your project.

**Q: Which project type is most common for 3-month programs?**  
**A:**
- 🏢 Internal System: 50%
- 🚀 New Application: 30%
- 🌍 Real-World App: 20%

Internal Systems dominate because 12 weeks allows building substantial, production-ready tools. New Applications are also popular for those building portfolios or startup MVPs.

---

### Q: What if I fail an assessment?

**A:** You'll get feedback and a chance to improve:
- **Weekly assessment:** Review feedback, try again
- **Final assessment:** May extend internship or adjust expectations
- **Honest conversation:** If not ready for production work, we'll tell you

Goal is growth, not gatekeeping. We want you to succeed.

---
